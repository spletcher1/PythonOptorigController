OPTOCONTROLLER COMMAND SEQUENCE TO ENSURE PROPER PROGRAM UPLOAD

COMMANDS
**Follow steps to locate and connect to your remote controller**
1)  versions
2)  times
      a.  settime (if needed, see DESCRIPTION below)
3)  load filename.txt 
4)  get 
5)  upload 
6)  get 
7)  save 

**steps 6, 7, and 8 are verification steps to ensure that your program will load on power up**

8)  clear 
9)  load 
10) get 


DESCRIPTION
1)  Check to ensure software and firmware versions are the same.
2)  Check to ensure local and remote times are the same or close enough. If no, execute step 2a.
      a. Will set the remote time to the current local time.
3)  Loads filename.txt from same folder into the local software.
4)  Downloads current program that is in RAM on controller and compares with local program.
5)  Uploads local program to replace the program currently on the controller RAM.
6)  Download the program you just uploaded to controller and check to ensure that it is identical with the local program.
7)  Saves the program that you just uploaded to the controller RAM onto its persistent storage (EEPROM/hard drive).  
        This is required so that your program automatically loads when the controller is powered up.

(steps 8, 9, and 10 are verification steps to ensure that your program will load on power up)

8)  This will clear your program out of the controller RAM.
9)  This will load the program currently on the controller EEPROM/hard drive into controller RAM.
10) This will download that program (currently in RAM) to your local computer and compare it to the local program.  
        If identical, then you can be sure that your program has been uploaded correctly and that it is saved to 
        the remote EEPROM so that it will automatically load and stage on power up.
